# Stress-Identification-IIOT-Project
Stress Identification Using IIOT integrates MAX30102 for heart rate monitoring, DHT11 for temperature sensing, and HC-05 Bluetooth module for data transmission. Collected data is published to MQTT for real-time analysis. The project includes a frontend interface for interactive visualization and detailed stress analysis.
